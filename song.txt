These days are getting real heavy
I'd break down if you let me go, oh-oh-oh
It could all go in an instant
Why wait when we could be living? Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I got no direction, that's alright
Forget it all for just the night, mm-mmm-mmm
Singing under string lights
Sipping till the sunrise
Living like we only got today
Swearing off the dark times
Cursing at the moonlight
Yeah, we might be lost
But we'll find our way
Oh, we'll find our way (whoa)
